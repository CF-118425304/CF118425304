        <h2 style="text-align:center"> Blockchain </h2>
        
        <p style="text-align:center"> Blockchain, a type of distributed ledger, promises to reshape industries by enabling trust,</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">providing transparency and reducing friction across business ecosystems potentially lowering costs,</p>
           <p style="text-align:center"> reducing transaction settlement times and improving cash ﬂow.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">Today, trust is placed in banks, clearinghouses,</p>
           <p style="text-align:center"> governments and many other institutions as central authorities with the “single version of the truth” maintained securely in their databases.</p>
           <p style="text-align:center"> The centralized trust model adds delays and friction costs (commissions, fees and the time value of money) to transactions.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">Blockchain provides an alternative trust mode and removes the need for central authorities in arbitrating transactions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Many blockchain initiatives today do not implement all of the attributes of blockchain — for example, a highly distributed database.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">These blockchain-inspired solutions are positioned as a means to achieve operational eﬃciency by automating business processes,</p>
<p style="text-align:center">or by digitizing records. They have the potential to enhance sharing of information among known entities,</p>
<p style="text-align:center">as well as improving opportunities for tracking and tracing physical and digital assets.</p> 
<p style="text-align:center">However, these approaches miss the value of true blockchain disruption and may increase vendor lock-in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Organizations choosing this option should understand the limitations and be prepared to move to complete</p>
<p style="text-align:center">blockchain solutions over time and that the same outcomes may be achieved with more eﬃcient and tuned use of existing nonblockchain technologies. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">More Info</a> </p>
